# Executes an instantiated workflow
# Single threaded javascript implementation
#
# 1. A job pool is necessary when executing the workflow instance, so that the
#    system doesn't generate too many threads.
# 2. An alternative is for each node to be locally responsible for spawning at most
#    X threads, and bundling groups of child nodes together to run synchronously
#
#
# States:
#
# making progress
#   active.length > 0
#
# can't make progress
#   active.length = 0
#   nothing in queue is ready
#
# done
#   active.length = 0
#   queue.length = 0
